A Python program for changing the background of an image allows users to replace the background of a photo with a different image or color. This can be useful for creating professional-looking photos, enhancing images for social media, or simply for fun.

Key Features:
Image Upload: Users can upload the image they want to edit.
Automatic Background Removal: The program uses techniques like image segmentation or machine learning to identify and remove the original background.
Preview: Users can see a preview of the edited image before saving it.
How It Works:
The program typically uses libraries like OpenCV or PIL (Pillow) for image processing.
It may also use machine learning models to accurately detect and remove backgrounds.
The final output is a new image with the original subject placed on the selected background.
This type of application is popular in graphic design, photography, and social media content creation.
